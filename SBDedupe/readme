The process of find deplicate with a record set should be a matter of
determining whether the posiblity of one record being a different version of
another record. If the posibility is great enough both record should be merged
creating a new and third superior record.

The problem is to colate all records into a data structure that allow for
records to be added in a persistent manner where by near duplicate records
are superseeded by newer ones so that their information is not lost but
rather evolved.

An evolutionary tree where branches can be made and closely
related records can be tracked. The reduction in computating likeness by
reducing comparative sample sized should also be inherit within
the chosen data structure.

Sameness should be a function of how close the
a record is to another in the data structure and if too close then the
records should be merged.

A complete list of current records will be a list of all externally exposed
records, not ancestor of any other record.
